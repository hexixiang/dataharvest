# DataHarvest

DataHarvest is a toolkit specifically designed for building datasets for large language models. It provides a series of pipelines for data acquisition, cleaning, and processing, aiming to deliver high-quality training data for Chinese large language models.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Automatically fetch data from various sources, including websites, APIs, documents, and more.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess data by removing noise, duplicates, and irrelevant content.
- **Data Transformation**: Convert data into formats suitable for training, such as text, sequences, etc.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Flexible pipeline configurations allow users to customize data processing workflows as needed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dataharvest.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Acquisition

```python
from dataharvest import data_fetcher

# Fetch data
data = data_fetcher.fetch_data(source='web', url='https://example.com')

# Save the data
data.to_csv('data.csv')
```

### Data Cleaning

```python
from dataharvest import data_cleaner

# Load data
data = data_cleaner.load_data('data.csv')

# Clean the data
clean_data = data_cleaner.clean(data)

# Save the cleaned data
clean_data.to_csv('clean_data.csv')
```

### Building a Pipeline

```python
from dataharvest import Pipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('fetch', data_fetcher.fetch_data),
    ('clean', data_cleaner.clean),
    ('transform', lambda x: x)  # Add additional transformation functions
])

# Execute the pipeline
processed_data = pipeline.execute(source='web', url='https://example.com')

# Save the processed data
processed_data.to_csv('processed_data.csv')
```
